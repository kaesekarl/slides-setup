## Warning 
This Project is still under Development! Breaking Changes can happen on any day i feel like or i just mess up.
The Documentation is de facto non-existant, i try to follow best practices when coding but you know how it is.
With caution and some apprechiation for bad Code go ahead :)

## What even is this here?
This is a Framework to create Presentations with Manim. Manim itself was Created by the Grant Sanderson,
better known as [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown). Afterwards the Community created the [Manim Community Edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) 
to make a better documented and more continued development.
This project was created because i found LaTeX-Beamer lacking in some areas for my personal taste of presentations
and i wanted to give other people a chance to look at my mess of a Codebase.

This Tool is intended to be used for Live-Presentations but it can also be used for normal Videos (like "Vanilla-Manim").
It is mostly based on Manim, i just added some Classes, Functions and CLI-Tools to help create a more visibly coherent presentation.

The Visual Style is **HEAVILY** influenced by [Karloso's LaTeX-Beamer Template](https://github.com/karlosos/zut-fibeamer) (Thx <3)

## Installation
Please follow the Instructions for [ManimCE](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) (Thx <3). Then you can just Clone or Fork this Repository and get started. 

## Usage
You should have a basic familiarity with Manim itself. The Community has some great Resources:

The official [Manim Docs](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials_guides.html)  
Benjamin Hackl has a good video series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUsUrbWb2D4&list=PLsMrDyoG1sZm6-jIUQCgN3BVyEVOZz3LQ)  

Afterwards you can use the Framework however you see fit. It is supplied with a lot of configuration in the config.py, 
if you wanna tweak colors, or basic layout, this is the place to go
